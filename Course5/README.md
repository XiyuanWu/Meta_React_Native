# Course 5: React Native

Refer to the [course syllabus](./README.md).

This course project involves building a subscription page for the Little Lemon app. 

Refer to the [detailed instructions](./instructions5.md).

Complete files refer to the folder. Note that this entire course is built on an app for Little Lemon, and I built it as the course progresses. Ultimately, I added a subscription feature to this app. The folder contains both content for the Little Lemon app, including build content, as well as the course and final assignments. 

## App Preview

This app contains three pages: Home, Settings and Subscribe.

<table>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="./Preview/Home.jpg" alt="Home" width="300"></td>
        <td><img src="./Preview/Settings.jpg" alt="Settings" width="300"></td>
        <td><img src="./Preview/Subscribe.jpg" alt="Subscribe" width="300"></td>
    </tr>
</table>

For the subscribe page, it has built-in email validation: if the email is valid, an error message is displayed; if the email is invalid, the subscription is successful. 

<table>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="./Preview/Sub-error.jpg" alt="Subscription Error" width="300"></td>
        <td><img src="./Preview/Sub-success.jpg" alt="Subscription Success" width="300"></td>
    </tr>
</table>
