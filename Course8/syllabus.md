# Course 8 syllabus

## Course content
This course will guide you in applying the knowledge and skills gained from the previous courses in the React Native program, in order to fulfil the requirements of the capstone project. Specifically, you will design and develop a mobile application using React Native which will be subjected to review by yourself as well as your peers.

To complete this course, you will need React Native experience.  

This course enables you to demonstrate multiple skills from this Certificate by solving an authentic real-world problem. Each module includes a brief recap of, and links to, content that you have covered in previous courses in this program. The course Capstone project will test your knowledge and understanding in mobile development using React Native. 

On completion of the Capstone project, you’ll have a job-ready portfolio that you can show to recruiters, demonstrate during interviews and impress potential employers.

The course is designed to be completed over a period of three weeks, during which you will go through setup and planning steps, write code for the application’s core functionalities, and complete a series of assessment tasks. The content covered is as follows:

- Design and implement an onboarding process for new users
- Design a navigational flow between screens of your app
- Implement a navigation interface
- Fetch data from the network and store it in a database
- Render data in the app in a way that allows information to be sorted and filtered

## Module 3: Project assessment
In the final module, you will be assessed on the fundamental skills covered as you build the capstone project's functionality.
