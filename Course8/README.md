Refer to the [course syllabus](./syllabus8.md).

Course 8 is a capstone project that showcases the knowledge and skills acquired throughout this course. The goal of this capstone project is to develop a comprehensive app for Little Lemon restaurant, encompassing features such as login, home, about, menu, and reservation.

Complete files refer to the [folder](./LittleLemon/).

## Preview

Here is the preview of the comprehensive Little Lemon app I made. Note that since there is no backend, this app mainly focuses on UI/UX.

1. First, the app has a welcome and sign up/log in page, and after logging in, this app uses drawer navigation:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="./Preview/welcome.png" alt="Welcome" width="300"></td>
        <td><img src="./Preview/login.png" alt="Log In" width="300"></td>
        <td><img src="./Preview/drawer nav.png" alt="Drawer Nav" width="300"></td>
    </tr>
</table>


2. The app has About, Menu, Reserve, and Subscribe pages. 

<table>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="./Preview/about.png" alt="About" width="300"></td>
        <td><img src="./Preview/menu.png" alt="Menu" width="300"></td>
        <td><img src="./Preview/reserve.png" alt="Reserve" width="300"></td>
        <td><img src="./Preview/subscribe.png" alt="Subscribe" width="300"></td>
    </tr>
</table>

3. The Menu page features a category tag that allows users to filter dishes by category.

<table>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="./Preview/appetizers.png" alt="Appetizers" width="300"></td>
        <td><img src="./Preview/main.png" alt="Main Dish" width="300"></td>
        <td><img src="./Preview/sides.png" alt="Sides" width="300"></td>
        <td><img src="./Preview/desserts.png" alt="Desserts" width="300"></td>
    </tr>
</table>

3. The Menu page is scrollable since there are many menu items. Here is a complete view:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="./Preview/full menu.jpg" alt="Full Menu" width="250"></td>
    </tr>
</table>
