## Course Content
This course builds upon the foundational knowledge you gained from the React Basics course. It will prepare you to develop a more complex mobile app experience using React Native.

The course is designed to be completed over five weeks. Each week, you will learn how to apply a new feature to enhance the appearance or usability of your app.  

## Week 1: Introduction to React Native 
The first week starts with an overview of React Native. You will learn about its role in mobile app development. You’ll then be instructed on how to set up a development environment before you start working with some of the core React Native components.

- Use StyleSheet to style components in React Native.

## Week 2: Lists and Text Input in React Native
In the second week, you will familiarize yourself with approaches for presenting large lists in a React Native app and enabling users to input text. While these may sound like basic tasks, it is essential to implement and configure these features thoughtfully, creating a better user experience.

## Week 3: Pressable, Images and Hooks in React Native 
In week three, you’ll learn how to enhance your app with interactivity and visuals. Specifically, you will learn how to add clickable areas and display images. You’ll also dive deeper into hooks to make your app more responsive to native device settings, thus creating a more integrated and seamless user experience.

After completing these lessons, you will be able to:
- Use the Pressable component to create touch interactivity in a React Native app.
- Display and style images in a React Native app.
- Use more advanced hooks to refine styling and interactivity in your app.

## Week 4: React Navigation 
After you’ve set up the major structural elements of your app, you’ll shift your focus to enabling users to move between screens. There are several approaches to doing this, and you’ll explore each to better understand the use cases in which they are best applied.

After completing these lessons, you will be able to:
- Install and set up React Navigation and Native Stack Navigator.
- Use React Navigation to set up navigation between screens.
- Create and configure a header bar in a React Native app.
- Configure tab and drawer navigation systems in a React Native app.

## Week 5: Graded Assessment 
In the course's final week, you’ll apply your knowledge to build a newsletter sign-up page in React Native. This will be followed by a peer review and a graded final assessment. After that, you will be guided to reflect on your experience with the course and decide the next steps in your learning journey.

After completing the project exercises, you will be able to:
- Add image, text, text input and button components to a React Native app.
- Apply styling to components.
- Set up a stack navigator that can be used to move between two screens.
