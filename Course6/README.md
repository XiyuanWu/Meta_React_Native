# Course 6: Working with Data

Refer to the [course syllabus](./README.md).

> When developing, the backend can be the same, no matter whether the frontend is a website or a mobile app. They can share the same backend. 

Overall, this course has combined some of the content from Meta Full Stack Developer, specifically [Introduction to Databases for Backend Development](https://github.com/XiyuanWu/Meta_Full_Stack_Developer/tree/main/Course08) and [APIs](https://github.com/XiyuanWu/Meta_Full_Stack_Developer/tree/main/Course10), with an approximate overlap of over 60%. 

However, the new content from this course includes data in react native. It also consists of a final module project. It's about data in React Native. 

Unlike web development, which requires a backend to call APIs, in some cases, such as creating a simple mobile app with basic features, a backend is not necessary. Instead, a database storage in React Native can meet the requirements. And there are two ways to store data: AsyncStorage and SQLite. 

This course project is about setting up the app menu.
