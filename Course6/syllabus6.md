# Course 6 syllabus

## Course Content
This course expands upon the knowledge you gained from the React Native course, and will prepare you to make more informed decisions about how you access, store, retrieve and present data within your React Native applications.

The course is designed to be completed over five weeks. You will learn about data and databases in a more general sense, and then proceed to become familiar with tools and practices for working with data specificallyin React Native.

## Week 1: Introduction to REST APIs
In the first week, you will start with an overview of APIs and a refresher on HTTP and HTTPS before you cover the basics of REST architecture and RESTful APIs. 

After completing the lesson items, you will be able to:
- Identify the key characteristics, benefits and uses of REST APIs
- Create API routes according to correct naming conventions and best practices
- Explain the principles of authentication in a REST API
- Differentiate between authentication and authorization
- Explain the API request lifecycle
- Create a basic API and organize an API project
- Explain different types of API output, like JSON and XML
- Use various tools for API development

## Week 2: Interacting with REST APIs in React Native
In the second week of the course, expect to explore REST APIs within the context of React Native. This entails knowing how to send requests and handle responses from a React Native application and using JSON as a means of handling complex data.

Once you’ve completed the lesson items from this week, you will know how to:
- Create HTTP requests in React Native
- Handle responses from the server in React Native
- Work with JSON data in React Native

## Week 3: Introduction to Databases and SQL
In the following week you’ll be introduced to databases, along with Structured Query Language (SQL), the coding syntax used to interact with them. You’ll also explore how tables are structured in databases, as well as how to differentiate between numeric data, string data and default values. 

Finally, you’ll gain the skills needed to perform Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) operations using SQL statements, which are key to building and altering tables.

By the end of the module, you will be able to:
- Explain what a database is, and how data is related in a database
- Explain what SQL is and the basic syntax that it adheres to
- Write SQL statements using some common commands
- Describe what tables are in databases, and how data is structured within them
- Differentiate between several common data types
- Create tables
- Perform CRUD operations

## Week 4: Data in React Native
Once you’ve reached the fourth week, you’ll become familiar with two useful data storage solutions for use with React Native, which are AsyncStorage and SQLite.

By week’s end, you’ll gain the ability to:
- Explain what AsyncStorage is
- Use AsyncStorage methods to store and retrieve data
- Explain what SQLite is and how it differs from AsyncStorage
- Call APIs from the SQLite library to perform read and write operations

## Week 5: Graded Assessment
In the course's final week, you’ll apply your knowledge to complete a Little Lemon mobile application, which should retrieve data about menu items from the server and then render the information within the app in an organized way. This will be followed by a peer review and a graded final assessment. After that, you will be guided to reflect on your experience with the course and decide the next steps in your learning journey.

In completing the project exercises, you will demonstrate your ability to:
- Fetch JSON data from the network
- Use a REST API query to store the data in SQLite
- Access the data from SQLite to render it within an app
- Apply filtering and sorting to the rendered data
